Although I am a computer science engineer but I identify myself as a creative builder, constantly seeking out unique opportunities to express my creativity. Since my school days, I have enjoyed crafting pieces of art and experimenting with everyday items like newspaper and cardboard boxes to create something new. I still remember the delight on my mother's face when I created a little fruit basket out of newspaper for her. As I have progressed in my career, I have infused this artistic inclination into my web-based projects, leading to the development of unique features, such as an aesthetically pleasing sudoku game with visually appealing color schemes and blinking effects that occur when a row, column, or box is successfully filled The creative culture at Google is what excites me the most about working here, as it is a place where creativity is valued and celebrated.
