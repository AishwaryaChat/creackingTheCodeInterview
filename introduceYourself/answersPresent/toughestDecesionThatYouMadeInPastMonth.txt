Tell me about a difficult dicesion that you made in past 6 months
technical

Situation

two solutions
    - using legacy code and iterations on that
    - start from scratch

Task
    - analyseing
    - time crunch
    - in solution 1 understanding the existing code base was time crunch
    - in solution 2 starting from scartch was time consuming, testing

Actions
    - I helped the team to identify wat can be reused and wat cannot be by collaborating with different team
    â€“ Since I was a person working at walmart from long time, so I utiilised my contacts to collaborate with different teams to understand the code base

Lessons
    - networking can help in faster decesion making and learning - sometimes an educated guess is wat we have to go forward with

use legacy code or use from scratch

situation
personal - solo trip
getting out of my comfort zone
- i like to be surrounded with known people
- when with people reponsibilities are divided
- you have to create that sense of enjoyment for yourself
being a married person you have to explain many other people why you
want to travel solo
