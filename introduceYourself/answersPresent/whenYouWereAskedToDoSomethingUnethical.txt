I was once asked to create a WhatsApp group for office work by my manager. Although I did not consider this request to be outright unethical, I did find it to be a potential breach of personal space for team members. As such, I felt it was important to address the situation.

To resolve the issue, I spoke to my manager and expressed my concerns about the company culture and how it may not encourage such actions. I suggested alternative solutions such as a daily stand-up meeting to discuss office concerns. However, I later learned that my manager's was not informed about walmart's culture
