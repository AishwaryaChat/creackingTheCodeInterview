-> Having worked in both small and large teams, I have found    that I tend to excel in smaller team environments.

-> I feel smaller teams tend to be more agile and efficient.

->  With fewer stakeholders involved, we can make quicker decisions and iterate on our work more rapidly. This allows us to be more nimble and responsive to changes in the marketplace or customer needs, ultimately leading to better outcomes.

 -> I appreciate the opportunity to connect with my colleagues on a more personal level, which is often easier in smaller teams. I find that in these settings, I am able to more effectively communicate my thoughts and ideas, resulting in a more collaborative and productive work experience.

-> Overall, while I can certainly work in larger teams and adapt to those environments, I believe that smaller teams play to my strengths and allow me to make the greatest impact.
