Situation:
    -> Existing solution for inventory management was not productive.
    -> The process was inefficient, particularly in terms of ordering inventory.
    -> The process was time-consuming, and we had tight timeline constraints.

Task:
    -> Provide an efficient solution for block-data filtering.
    -> Work within the given design constraints.

Action:
    -> Thought of providing an out-of-the-box solution.
    -> Got a hint from already existing data.
    -> Provided a solution using a 3D library.
    -> Worked parallelly on both the proposed solution and a proof of concept for my solution.
    -> Collaborated with other team members to understand existing APIs.
    -> Showed passion and enthusiasm for the project.
    -> Engaged in cross-functional teamwork and collaboration.
    -> Found the task enjoyable and a great learning experience.

Challenges:
    -> Collaboration with multiple teams, each with its own priorities and schedules.
    -> Ensuring seamless integration with existing systems.

Results:
    -> Delivered an optimized solution.
    -> Streamlined the inventory management process, making it more efficient and less time-consuming.
    -> Received praise from users and the team.
    -> Improved overall productivity and user satisfaction.
    -> Created valuable relationships across different teams in the company.

Learning:
    -> Ideas can come at any time; it's essential to question existing solutions (first principle thinking).
    -> Highlighted the importance of task estimation.
    -> Emphasized the value of approaching new and innovative solutions.
    -> Understood the importance of design considerations in developing solutions.

Keywords:
    -> Passion
    -> Cross-functional teamwork
    -> Collaboration
    -> Innovation

    -> worked parallelly both on proposed solution and on proof of concept of my solution
    -> had to collaborate with other team members to understand existing apis
    -> KEYWORDS - show passion, show cross functional team work, team collaboration, show how enjoyable the task was

Challenges
    -> Coolaboration with multiple teams

Results
    -> optimised solution
    -> got praise from users and the team
    -> connected with different teams across the company and created valuable relationships

Learning

    -> Idea can come any time, its just that we have to first question on existing solution (first principle thinking)
    -> KEYWORDS - task estimation, approaching new and innovative solutions, design considerations


    
One of my most significant accomplishments in my previous work was leading a project where I had to develop a creative solution to solve a problem at Walmart. Our team was working on a feature that required us to display block-related fixture data for a store. However, the existing product was not delivering efficient results, leading to delays in meeting business deadlines.

To address this, I decided to challenge myself and find a more innovative solution. I observed that we had svg files available for our store layouts that included block-related data, and we also had APIs to fetch data based on blocks. So, I created a proof of concept using the D3 library to display a 3D model of the store, leveraging the svg files and API data.
