What makes a good software engineer?

In my opinion, a good software engineer possesses a combination of technical expertise, domain business knowledge and behavioural qualities. From a technical standpoint, they should have strong problem-solving skills and be able to develop effective and robust solutions. Additionally, they should have a deep understanding of programming languages, software development principles, and tools.

On the behavioural side, good communication skills are crucial. A software engineer needs to be able to convey their ideas clearly to the team and work collaboratively with others. They should also be open to feedback and willing to work effectively in a team environment. Furthermore, it's important for a software engineer to have a mindset of continuous learning. In a rapidly evolving industry like ours, it's essential to keep up with new technologies and best practices. I personally cultivate this habit by taking short courses to learn something new or deepen my understanding of a particular topic.
