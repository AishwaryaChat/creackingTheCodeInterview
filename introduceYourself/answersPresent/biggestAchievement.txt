Situation:
    -> Product was an inventory management solution in walmart for physical store modelling. The existing solution was not productive and I got to know about this in a business meeting that I attended for our quarter results.
    -> Remodelling is a time bounded process
    -> Existing solution for inventory management was not productive.
    -> The process was inefficient, particularly in terms of ordering inventory.
    -> The process was time-consuming, and we had tight timeline constraints.

Task:
    -> Provide an efficient solution for block-data filtering.
    -> Work within the given design constraints.

Action:
    -> I was aware of a system at walmart which was showing 2D layout of the stores, so I thought if we can reuse this
    -> I connected with the that team's team members and understood the apis they were using and understood the api responses
    -> I gathered all the information and I thought of providing an out of the box solution which will help the users and make the process faster. I suggested of providing an interactive 2D layout of the stores, where clicking on a block will filter the inventory items of that block
    -> I then scheduled a call with my manager and our architect and jotted down all the points like the api's we will be using and features we can provide and also a POC for this and presented it in the meeting
    -> After multiple discussions with design team and the architects I got the green signal to go ahead with the task
    -> The next action item was to break down the task into smaller tasks, do estimations for each of these tasks and delegate it to the team members and 
     -> I created a roadmap for this by dividing the task into four segments: development, unit testing, feature flag-based testing in the staging environment, and rollout to production.

    -> Showed passion and enthusiasm for the project.
    -> Engaged in cross-functional teamwork and collaboration.
    -> Found the task enjoyable and a great learning experience.

Challenges:
    -> D3 was a new tech altogether for the team, and this posed a challenge to our project timeline and overall quality
    -> mitigation: 
        1. I attended trainings, tutorials and workshops and educated the team by organising KT sessions
        2. I reached out to colleagues in other teams who had experience with the technology, and arranged KT sessions with them
        3. I also set up a sandbox environment where the team could experiment and practice with the new technology, and we did this once or twice in a week, we even use to pair program

    -> the APIs we needed to use were designed for a legacy system and were not optimized for our architecture
        1. I initiated the creation of a middleware or transformation layer that would sit between the legacy APIs and our application. This layer was responsible for cleaning, normalizing, and transforming the legacy data into a format that our system could efficiently process. This approach allowed us to decouple our system from the intricacies of the legacy APIs
        2. Given the complexity of working with legacy data, I emphasized the importance of thorough testing. We created comprehensive test cases that covered various edge cases, ensuring that the transformed data met our applicationâ€™s requirements. I also set up monitoring and alerting to detect any issues in the data transformation process early.
        3.Understanding the potential instability of legacy systems, I implemented robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. This ensured that our system could gracefully handle failures from the legacy APIs without disrupting the user experience.

    Results: 
        -> Streamlined the inventory management process, making it more efficient and less time-consuming to order the inventory.
        -> Significantly it improved time to order inventory for a single block and collectively for a store
        -> We got praise from the business stake holders and the primary users of the tool
        -> I have even been awarded for the next qurter spot award for this

    Working on D3 js was new form the team, so educating them was challenging, and I educated myself and the team by taking knowledge sharing sessions.
    -> Collaboration with multiple teams, each with its own priorities and schedules.

    -> Ensuring seamless integration with existing systems.

Results:
    -> Delivered an optimized solution.
    -> Streamlined the inventory management process, making it more efficient and less time-consuming.
    -> Received praise from users and the team.
    -> Improved overall productivity and user satisfaction.
    -> Created valuable relationships across different teams in the company.

Learning:
    -> Ideas can come at any time; it's essential to question existing solutions (first principle thinking).
    -> Highlighted the importance of task estimation.
    -> Emphasized the value of approaching new and innovative solutions.
    -> Understood the importance of design considerations in developing solutions.

Situation
    -> Existing solution for inventory management was not productive
    -> Present solution was not efficient, efficient not in terms of ordering the inventory, process was time consuming -> timeline constraint

Task
    -> Provide efficient solution for block-data filtering
    -> with given design

Action
    -> thought of providing Out of box solution
    -> got a hint from already existing data
    -> Provided a solution using 3D library
    -> worked parallelly both on proposed solution and on proof of concept of my solution
    -> had to collaborate with other team members to understand existing apis
    -> KEYWORDS - show passion, show cross functional team work, team collaboration, show how enjoyable the task was

Challenges
    -> Coolaboration with multiple teams

Results
    -> optimised solution
    -> got praise from users and the team
    -> connected with different teams across the company and created valuable relationships

Learning

    -> Idea can come any time, its just that we have to first question on existing solution (first principle thinking)
    -> KEYWORDS - task estimation, approaching new and innovative solutions, design considerations


    
One of my most significant accomplishments in my previous work was leading a project where I had to develop a creative solution to solve a problem at Walmart. Our team was working on a feature that required us to display block-related fixture data for a store. However, the existing product was not delivering efficient results, leading to delays in meeting business deadlines.

To address this, I decided to challenge myself and find a more innovative solution. I observed that we had svg files available for our store layouts that included block-related data, and we also had APIs to fetch data based on blocks. So, I created a proof of concept using the D3 library to display a 3D model of the store, leveraging the svg files and API data.
