During a new project, I encountered a pushy manager whose behavior was making it difficult for me to work effectively. I knew that I needed to address the situation quickly to prevent it from impacting the project's productivity and deliverables. To start, I took some time to observe the manager's behavior and understand if this was a pattern of behavior or just related to specific tasks or deadlines. After observing for a couple of weeks, I realized that his behavior was consistently pushy.

To address the issue, I scheduled a one-on-one conversation with my manager and prepared a list of bullet points to cover during the meeting. I started by explaining how the situation was affecting my work and then listened to his perspective to understand where he was coming from. It turned out that his behavior was a result of the work culture he was used to.

During the conversation, I presented my preferred ways of working, such as taking time to think before taking action, and explained how these methods had worked well for me in the past. We were able to align our expectations and ways of working, resulting in a better working relationship.

This experience taught me the importance of frequent communication to prevent conflicts and misunderstandings. I also learned that it's essential to try to understand other people's perspectives, even if they come from a different work culture, to find a common ground and work effectively as a team.
