If I found myself in a negative environment at work, I would first take a step back and assess the situation. I would try to understand what exactly is causing the negativity - whether it's due to external factors like company policies or internal factors like team dynamics.

Once I have a good understanding of the root causes, I would try to address them one by one. For example, if the negativity is due to team dynamics, I would try to foster a more positive and collaborative culture by encouraging open communication, establishing shared goals, and recognizing the contributions of team members. If the negativity is due to external factors, I would try to advocate for changes in policies or procedures that are causing problems.

In addition, I would try to lead by example and model the behaviors that I would like to see in others. For instance, I would try to remain positive and optimistic even in the face of challenges or setbacks, and I would strive to maintain a solutions-oriented mindset rather than dwelling on problems.

Overall, I believe that a positive work environment is critical for success, both for individuals and for teams. By taking proactive steps to address negativity and foster a positive culture, I believe that it's possible to create a more productive, fulfilling, and successful work environment that benefits everyone involved. This aligns with Google's value of creating a positive and inclusive workplace culture.
