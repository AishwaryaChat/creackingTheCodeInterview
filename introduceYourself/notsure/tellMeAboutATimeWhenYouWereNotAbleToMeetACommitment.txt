Situation
    -> 

One instance where I was not able to meet a commitment was during my time as a project manager for a software development project. We had a deadline to deliver a particular feature, and I was responsible for ensuring that the team met the timeline.

However, as the deadline approached, it became clear that we were not going to be able to deliver the feature on time. I immediately informed my manager about the situation and worked with the team to understand the root cause of the delay.

As per Google's values of "transparency" and "ownership," I took complete responsibility for the delay and ensured that all stakeholders were aware of the situation. I worked with the team to come up with a new timeline and communicated the revised plan to all stakeholders.

Additionally, I ensured that we learned from this experience and implemented measures to prevent such delays in the future. This included better estimation techniques, improved communication, and identifying potential risks earlier in the project lifecycle.

I believe this experience demonstrated my ability to take ownership of my mistakes and work collaboratively with my team to find solutions. It also highlighted my commitment to transparency, where I kept all stakeholders informed and demonstrated the importance of learning from mistakes to prevent future occurrences.


There were a few factors that prevented me from meeting the commitment. One of the main issues was the unexpected increase in workload due to a sudden change in project requirements. This caused us to have to reprioritize tasks and shift resources around, which made it challenging to keep up with all of the deadlines.

Additionally, there were some unforeseen technical difficulties that caused some delays in the project timeline. We had to spend more time than anticipated on troubleshooting and finding solutions to these issues, which took time away from other tasks and caused us to fall behind schedule.

Lastly, I also underestimated the amount of time and resources that would be required to complete certain tasks. I thought I had a good understanding of what was needed at the beginning, but as we got further into the project, it became clear that we needed more resources and time to complete everything on time.

Despite these challenges, I learned a lot from the experience and have implemented changes in my approach to project planning and task estimation to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. I also made sure to communicate openly with my team and stakeholders throughout the process to keep everyone updated on our progress and any roadblocks we were facing.
