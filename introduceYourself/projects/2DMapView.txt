Tech used
    -> D3 JS
    -> leaflet JS
    -> d3-quadtree

Challenges
    -> Performance Optimization:

        -> Challenge: Rendering complex store layouts with many data points (such as product locations) can be performance-intensive, especially when users zoom or pan the map.
        -> Solution: Optimize rendering by using techniques like spatial indexing (e.g., quadtrees) to limit the number of objects rendered at a time. Consider using canvas layers for large numbers of objects.
